* Receipt number
* Invoice number
* Check number

Validations or error handling:

* Validates the input data against the accounting records to ensure accuracy.
* Handles errors such as incorrect payment amounts, vouchers, and receipts by printing error messages on the screen or in electronic format.

Files or subroutines called:

* Calls the GL validation subroutine to verify the payment amount against the accounting records.
* Calls the receipt and 1099 tracking subroutine to generate printouts or electronic outputs for these documents.

## Chunk 2

Use Case Title: Payment of invoices to vendors.
What the code does: The RPG code checks the accounts payable voucher and process payment details for vendor. The program validates the check date, check number, and account number before processing the payment. If there is a failure, an error message will be displayed.

## Chunk 3

Use Case Title: Vendor Processing and GL Validation

What the code does: This RPG program processes vendor invoices by extracting data from an Invoice file (AXRECD) and populating an Accounts Payable file (APPYCK). It also validates the GL entries generated during the processing of each invoice. The program uses subroutines L1DET and L2DET to format the output of the APPYCK file, and CHECK to validate the GL transactions.

Files or subroutines called: The program calls subroutine CHECK to validate the GL transactions, and uses subroutines L1DET and L2DET to format the output of the APPYCK file.

## Chunk 4

Use Case Title: Generate Accounts Payable Voucher for Vendor Processing and GL Validation

What the code does:
This RPG code generates an accounts payable voucher, including vendor information, invoice details, payment records, 1099 tracking, and receipts. The code validates GL transactions to ensure that they are properly recorded and processed.
